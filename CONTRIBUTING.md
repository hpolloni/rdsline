Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project!

In order to set things up you will need Python 3 (I have 3.7.8 installed at the moment).

Run `make setup-dev` in order to create a virtualenv and install requirements.

Run `make check` to run static analysis. We use mypy, black and pylint.
